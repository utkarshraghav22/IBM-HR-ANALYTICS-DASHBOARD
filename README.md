# IBM-HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD
# This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition at IBM using an HR dataset. The goal is to uncover key insights into the factors influencing employee turnover, helping HR and management teams make data-driven decisions to improve retention.
The interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of workforce demographics, attrition patterns, and business-related variables. Key visualizations include:

Total Employees and Attrition Overview
Gender Distribution
Attrition by Department, Job Role, and Education Field
Attrition vs. Salary, Distance from Home, and Overtime
Workforce Composition by Age, Marital Status, and Education

The analysis highlights potential attrition drivers such as long commute distances, low income, frequent overtime, and certain job roles or departments. This enables HR teams to identify risk areas, implement targeted retention strategies, and enhance employee satisfaction.
